This example demonstrate different ways of disabling the model editing from SOLIDWORKS API: 

* Blocking menu - user is not able to invoke menu commands. This feature is usually used when property manager page is displayed and there should be no commands invoked
* Blocking model editing - model is a view only and cannot be changed
* Full block - editing and view manipulations are disabled

It is required to debug macro step-by-step to see the different SOLIDWORKS API functions in action.
