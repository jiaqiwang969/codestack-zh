This macro emulates the functionality of [Defeature for Part](https://help.solidworks.com/2018/english/solidworks/sldworks/c_defeature_for_parts.htm) but not using it directly.

Macro copies all visible solid and surface bodies, deletes all user features and imports the copied bodies using SOLIDWORKS API.

**Before:**

![Part with feature tree](part-feature-tree.png){ width=350 }

**After:**
![Part with defeatured tree](part-feature-tree-defeatured.png){ width=350 }
