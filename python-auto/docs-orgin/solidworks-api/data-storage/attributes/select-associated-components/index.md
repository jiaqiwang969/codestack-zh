This example attaches to the selection SOLIDWORKS API events of the active assembly via [NewSelectionNotify](https://help.solidworks.com/2018/english/api/sldworksapi/solidworks.interop.sldworks~solidworks.interop.sldworks.dassemblydocevents_newselectionnotifyeventhandler.html) notification.

If the attribute is selected and there is a component associated with this attribute - this component will be selected in the tree.  

Macro will stop once the active assembly is closed.
